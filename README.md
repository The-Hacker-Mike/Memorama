# Memorama
This is a repo for a popular board game called "Memorama" in Mexico. It's a personal project that I'm developing using C++
When it's finished, I plan to add collaborators from the community and friends in order to improve the project and give it other super cool features.
I'm looking forward to how awesome the project will look like in the future.
